# <Prework Study Guide>

## Description

The Prework Study Guide is an introduction to Full Stack Development that showcases direct use of newly learned skills.
In order to better comprehend the coursework in this new career field, much thought has gone into this project for learning purposes.
This project has been built for educational purposes, and it serves the Prework Modules of development as a fundamental resource.
Full stack development is a very detailed process, and this Prework Study Guide helps break that down for ease of learning.
During the creation of this project I learned how each individual program/element works together to create a functional, interactive website page.
